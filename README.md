# Email-Account-Generator-By-JAVA
This is core/Basic JAVA project To Create Email by terminal. Practice Purpose

What's New(for me):
1. Taking a Password as input. but while typing, character will not show.
2.next(), nextInt(), taking an integer and give enter. this newline will stay on buffer. But for nextLine(), pressing enter will not stay on buffer.
